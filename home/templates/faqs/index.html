        Hairways is here to bridge the gap between Salon owners and their (prospective)Castomers
        We do this by providing Salons a platform to be found by their castumers. Castomers can see and rank
        Salons and review or write a short review of Salons they have visited.
        They can also book for Salon services from their Salon of via Hairways.</p>
