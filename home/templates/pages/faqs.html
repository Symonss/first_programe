  <h3>What is hairways?</h3>
  <p>
    Hairways is here to bridge the gap between Salon owners and their (prospective)Castomers
    We do this by providing Salons a platform to be found by their castumers. Castomers can see and rank
    Salons and review or write a short review of Salons they have visited.
    They can also book for Salon services from their Salon of via Hairways.</p>

  <h3>How do I get my Salon listed?</h3>
  <p>
    Simple just <i><a>create an account<a></i> with us and confirm Your
    email address. Then from your dashboard feed in your Salon details and choose your
    favourite plan. Once your subscription is confirmed your salon will be up and running.
